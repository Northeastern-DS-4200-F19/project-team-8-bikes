# S-L Project Template

This template will help you get started with your project. Please look through all these materials so you know how to organize your project.

## The Associated GitHub Pages Website

This website is served automatically from the default `gh-pages` branch at https://northeastern-ds-4200-f19-staff.github.io/S-L-Project-Template/

## Root Files
* `README.md` is this explanatory file for the repo.

* `index.html` contains the main website content. It includes comments surrounded by `<!--` and `-->` to help guide you through making your edits.

* `style.css` contains the CSS.

* `visualization.js` will contain your JavaScript and D3 code.

* `LICENCE` is your source code license.

## Folders
Each folder has an explanatory `README.md` file

* `data` is where you will put your data files.

* `favicons` contains the favicons for the course projects. You shouldn't change anything here.

* `files` will contain your slides (PDF) and video (MP4).

* `images` will contain your screenshots, diagrams, and photos.

* `lib` will contain any JavaScript library you use. It currently includes D3.

## Workflow

As you work with your team, you may have issues merging your changes. We recommend you pick one member of the team to be the project manager and deal with merging any pull requests.

Instead of all working directly out of the main `gh-pages` branch, you can try adopting a Git branching model for development. See, e.g., [this article by Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and the included image:
