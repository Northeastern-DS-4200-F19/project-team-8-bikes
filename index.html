    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p> This project was jointly created with the Chester Square Neighborhood Association. The goal of the neighborhood is to utilize visualizations to illustrate the current bike safety in the neighborhood. Massachusetts Avenue is a route taken by a great amount of commuters and residents often times feel unsafe using their bikes.
       Due to the high car traffic in the area accidents between motor vehicles and bikes frequently occur thus becoming a serious issue. </p>

    <p> To meet the neighborhood's goals as a team we focused on bike lanes. When we went down to Massachusetts Avenue and observed Chester Square
       we noticed that cars and construction trucks were hindering the bike lanes and it was clear that the safety of bikers in the bike lanes were not optimal.   </p>

    <p>  In order to effectively identify which parts in the Chester Square Neighborhood is in need of additional infrastructure, we examined the different types of bike lanes across various neighborhoods
       in the city of Boston and how bike accidents have a correlation with car traffic and bike lane types.</p>

    <p> The intent of the visualizations below is to be used as a reference when the neighborhood requests policy changes or additional infrastructure for bike lanes.
      We hope that our visualization leads to improvement in bike safety in the neighborhood in the future.
    </p>

        <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
        <p>
            We decided to use a stacked bar graph, because it was the best method for displaying bike lane type distribution
            so that comparing different streets is as simple as possible. Using
        </p>
        <p>
            We decided to use line graph with a line for each of motor vehicle and bike traffic was the best way to
            discover correlations between each other, as well as comparisons between streets. The low-opacity average line
            that remains visible while the view is filtered can help
        </p>
        <p>
            For our third graph displaying bike crashes on different streets, we chose to use a bar graph for ease of
            comparison between different streets as well as with the full-height bar graph.
        </p>

        <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            We used 3 different sources of data to construct this visualization; they are: a geographical map of bike lanes
            in Boston, a spreadsheet of vehicle counts for bikes and motor vehicles at specific locations around Boston,
            and a list of bicycle crashes in Boston.

            <dl>
              <dt><b>Vision Zero Crash Records(csv)</b></dt>
              <dd>Data contains crash reports for crashes involving cars, bikes, and pedestrians in Boston.
                We filtered to show only bike incidents and accidents that occured in the past year. This data was used to create the accident bar chart.</dd>
              </br>
              <dt><b>2017 Boston Bicycle Counts(csv)</b></dt>
              <dd>Data contains both bicycle and motor vehicle counts by the hour for 62 locations in Boston 2017. This data was used in the line chart.</dd>
              </br>
              <dt><b>EXISTING BIKE NETWORK(geojson)</b></dt>
              <dd>Existing Bike network within the City of Boston.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
            To construct our final dataset, we calculated the portions of each street we examined that was covered
            with each type of bike lane, and added the bike lane type to the crash data for those streets.
        </p>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <p>By the end, we had made significant changes to our original design. We quickly moved away from the idea of
            representing
            the information using a map, since we wanted to paint a better picture of bike safety for the greater Boston
            area. As a
            group, we decided that the map was not crucial in describing bike safety in Boston, since the geographical
            location
            wasnâ€™t nearly as important as the bike lane type, number of crashes, and traffic levels. We then made some
            smaller
            design choices and tweaks. For instance, we decided not to allow the user to filter traffic by bike lane type,
            since we
            only had that information for a very limited number of streets. This was similar to many of our decisions, as it
            was
            based on what we had available to us. Our data definitely limited our options in terms of the details of our
            visualization, since we could only present what we could find. Lastly, we also decided to include data for a
            greater
            number and portion of streets, instead of sticking to the Chester Square area, since we knew people biking in
            that
            area would likely be biking in the surrounding area as well. We also thought it was important to compare
            different
            streets around Boston, thinking comparison in safety levels could be significant regardless of the distance from
            Chester Square.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Our visualization allows the user to compare car and bike traffic to accidents and bike lane types for the Boston
            area.
            This discussion is imperative in regards to the improvement of bike safety in Chester Square and greater Boston
            area.
            From the data available to us, we faced high level of difficulty in drawing correlations between bike lane types
            and
            the number of accidents on certain streets. The majority of the number of accidents for certain bike lane type
            on a
            certain street made sense in terms of the proportion of the bike lane type on that street. However, we were able
            to
            find streets where the number of accidents was disproportionate to the level of traffic. For example,
            Massachusetts
            Ave had significantly more accidents than any other street, which on first look, makes sense as its traffic
            level is
            much higher than the average. After comparing to the other streets, however, it is apparent that Beacon Street
            has a
            similar traffic level with less than half the number of accidents. From our data alone, it is difficult to
            conclude
            that Mass Ave has a bike safety problem, but it demonstrates a potential problem and calls for further
            investigation.
            In the future, it would be helpful to have more precise data sets, especially for car and bike traffic, since
            that
            would assist greatly in the search for a correlation. Better data would allow for definitive conclusions to be
            drawn
            about bike safety on the different streets, rather than just displaying a more general picture and highlighting
            some
            potential danger areas. Lastly, it would also be helpful to do a more in-depth study of the different bike lane
            types to determine why certain types may be better than others. For people attempting to install safer bike
            lanes,
            it would be helpful to know what bikers like better and why certain lanes will keep them safer.
