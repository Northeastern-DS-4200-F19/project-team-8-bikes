    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p> The Chesterhood neighbor hood is in need for additional infrastructure for bike users. Our visualization examines the different types of bike lanes in various neighborhoods of Boston and displays how bike accidents have an correlation with traffic and bike lanes types.  </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    <p>We thought a stacked bar graph was the best method for displaying bike lane type distribution since it makes comparing different streets as simple as possible.
       We decided to use line graph with lines for both car and bike traffic was best visualization for discovering correlations between each other as well as for the different streets.
    </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>
        We used 3 different sources of data to construct this visualization; they are: a geographical map of bike lanes
        in Boston, a spreadsheet of vehicle counts for bikes and motor vehicles at specific locations around Boston,
        and a list of bicycle crashes in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
        To construct our final dataset, we calculated the portions of each street we examined that was covered
        with each type of bike lane, and added the bike lane type to the crash data for those streets.
    </p>


    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <OL>
        <LI>Comparing bike and car traffic patterns for Mass Ave and other streets.
          <UL>
              <LI>Gather bike & car traffic data across different neighborhoods in Boston
              <LI>Analyze car and biking patterns across time
          </UL>

        <LI>Identify the different types of bike lanes in streets of Boston
          <UL>
            <LI>Obtain all types of bike lanes in a street
            <LI>Calculate the portion of how much each bike lanes takes up of the street
          </UL>

          <LI>Examine the bike lanes compared to other neighborhoods.
            <UL>
              <LI>Aggregate bike lanes across neighborhoods
              <LI>Identify bike accident trends across neighborhoods
            </UL>


          </OL>

</p>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>By the end, we had made significant changes to our original design. We quickly moved away from the idea of representing
       the information using a map, since we wanted to paint a better picture of bike safety for the greater Boston area. We then
       made some smaller design choices and tweaks. For instance, we decided not to allow the user to filter traffic by bike lane
       type, since we only had that information for a very limited number of streets. We also decided include data for a greater
       number and portion of streets, instead of sticking to the Chester Square area, since we knew people biking in that area
       would likely be biking in the surrounding area as well. We also thought it was important to compare different streets around
       Boston, thinking comparison in safety levels could be significant regardless of the distance from Chester Square.
    </p>
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>
    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
        Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
        Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Our visualization allows the user to compare car and bike traffic to accidents and bike lane types for the Boston area.
       This dicussion is imperative in regards to the improvement of bike safety in Chester Square and greater Boston area.
       In the future, it would be helpful to have more precise data sets, especially for car and bike traffic, since that
       would assist greatly in the search for a correlation. It would also be helpful to do a more in-depth study of the different
       bike lane types to determine why certain types may be better than others. </p>
